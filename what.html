<h2>What Happened?</h2>

<p>
This is my (Sheldon here) account of what happened based on what I've heard from David, Jennifer, and the rest of the family.  This is as accurate as any account that doesn't come from David or Jennifer.  As I get more information I'll add or modify the text here.  If you have soemthing to add or a correction please contact me so I can make the change as soon as possible.  If you have your own account of what happened send it to me and I'll put it here too.

It's late on Tuesday, January 7th 2003.  The encore of "The Shield" is playing on the television in the living room sometime past 11pm.  The three kids were playing in the room sharing a wall with the living room.  Soon, Zack and Samatha come out of the room and join their parents in the living room.  Jennifer asks them what Troy is doing.  They respond saying he's sleeping in the room next door.  It's past their bed time and not surprizing that one of the kids would tire out and fall asleep on the floor somewhere.

A little later Jennifer decides to go and check on Troy (probably to pick him up and put him to bed).  She sees him sitting on the floor leaning up against the chair.  She's seen him there before and for a few seconds thinks nothing of it.  As she gets closer she sees that Troy has lost his color.  He is already turning white and purple.  More and more concerned as she approaches Troy she realizes that the cord from the mini-blinds is wrapped around his neck.  She picks him up and starts screaming for David.  She starts CPR in the bedroom while David calls 911.

The parametics arrive in less than 5 minutes.  They work on Troy for about 45 minutes in the living room of the apartment.  A helicopter takes Troy from the apartment to the hospital.

Troy is at the hospital for another hour before doctors come out to tell the family that Troy passed away.  Anguish fills the waiting room.
