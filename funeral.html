<h2>Our Beloved Angel Troy Troy</h2>

His short life began July 30 2001 being the first born of twins. <br>
Shortly after birth his twin, Samantha experienced breathing <br>
Problems, nurses administered oxygen but there was no <br>
Improvement and our fears grew. That was until nurses placed <br>
Troy next to her and within minutes her breathing became <br>
Normal and all fears vanished.  We knew then that Troy was  <br>
Truly a special gift from heaven. <br>
Troy may have started life as the smaller twin but that wouldn't <br>
Last long.  He quickly out grew his twin and excelled by <br>
Crawling first, walking first and uttering the first  <br>
Understandable words.  He tried so hard to keep up with and <br>
Even out do his older brother Zachary. <br>
Troy loved to play, laugh, jump, run, climb, go to school, <br>
Vista Granny & Grandpa, play with friends and family and most <br>
Of all snuggle up close with Mommy, Daddy, Brother & Sister <br>
At the end of a long day. <br>
Troy was always smiling, eyes sparkling with excitement and <br>
Rosy cheeks. The Lord blessed us for a short time with his <br>
Presence, but he will forever live within our hearts. <br>
On January 7, 2003 while playing with his brother and sister <br>
Our heavenly father gathered Troy into his loving arms and <br>
Delivered our angle to heaven in the early morning hours of <br>
January 8th. Troy will join many loving family members who <br>
Went before him, to care for and watch over him until each one <br>
Of us can join him there. <br>
We thought our time was just beginning with this precious <br>
Angle, when in fact, our Father was already calling him home. <br>
Troy did not go alone, for part of us went with him. <br>
Our love forever! <br>
