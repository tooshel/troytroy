Januaray 2003: I know it doesn't seem obvious but troytroy.com has been redesigned!!!!  I know - so it only looks like I changed the colors of the links at the left but it goes far beyond that.  Instead of using tables for the layout I've switched to using CSS.  That doesn't mean much to people who don't design websites and since it looks the same you may not care.  But here is where it makes a difference.  When you print a page from troytroy.com it'll look good!!!  Try it and see.

<h3>May 2012</h3>

<p>
It has been over 9 years since I put this site up and not much has changed on the site itself but SO MUCH has changed in all of our lives. Sam and Zack are 
almost teenagers! It's insane how fast time flies. I suspect this comming January is going to be a tough month as we reflect back on those 10 years without Troy.
</p>

<p>
A big change in MY life is I have a daughter born almost 2 months ago on 4/6/2012. I am INCREDABLY proud as you can tell when you visit 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.embrie.com">her site</a>. 
Whenever I see her sleep with her hand crossed across her body I have flashbacks of seeing Troy in the casket. 
Even 10 years later I still don't want to post those photos. 
</p>

<p>
I would LOVE to post new photos of the family. If you have some, send them my way. Yeah, yeah, you all use facebook or whatever. 
But think about this . . . there WAS NO facebook 10 years ago . . . will there be a facebook in 10 years?
</p>

As always, feel free to contact me if you have ideas, comments, or something to add.
