Why do you omit the @ sign from your email address?

<p>
SPAMers, people who make a business of sending unsolicited bulk email (UBE), set up bots that scan sites for email addresses that appear on web pages.  They do this by looking for the @ sign and grabbing all the text around it.  By omitting the @ sign I have a better chance of not getting on their lists.  This is, of course, until they start looking for "at".  Some people would write my email address like this: sheldon at mcgee dot net.  Yeah, it would be easier if you could just click on a link and I'll add that convience when a) a law gets pasted that stops UBE or b) doing the sheldon "at" mcgee.net thing doesn't work anymore.
