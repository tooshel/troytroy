<h2>An Early Goodbye</h2>

There is pain in an early good-bye, <br>
There are so many dreams you must set aside, <br>
So many memories to cause you pain, <br>
So many plans to change. <br>
There is pain in an early good-bye. <br>
There are so many times when you question why, <br>
So many feelings you must deny, <br>
So many tears. <br>
There are so many things I wanted to say, <br>
So many reasons I hoped you could stay. <br>
<u>I LOVED YOU COMPLETELY</u>; I have some regrets, <br>
But I just wasn't ready yet. <br>
So I'll try with all my heart to make some sense of it. <br>
And there's only one power to lean upon, <br>
And there's only one reason to go on. <br>
I believe in the wisdom of God. <br>
He ruleth the seasons, he faileth us not. <br>
This kind of sorrow he has also known, <br>
Do not walk alone. <br>
Here is nothing and no one to blame, <br>
And there's no use in thinking what might have been. <br>
I would have kept you through life's short span, <br>
But God had a different plan. <br>
So I'll pray for the day when sorrow will cease, <br>
For the day when I know perfect peace. <br>
I'll find the courage to make it somehow, <br>
But I'm feeling so lonely now. <br>
So I'll cry a little bit, and try a little bit, <br>
And I'll trust in God to make some sense of it. <br>
Then my eye will be single to one star, <br>
To live my life worthy of where you are. <br>
But today its not easy, today I may cry, <br>
So if you see the tears in my eyes, <br>
It's the pain of an early good-bye. <br>
